/**
 * Class definition to model a water utility bill.  There are three components to the bill:
 *  Fixed cost for having the service.
 *  Water cost, based on usage - defined as all water dispensed from the system.
 *  Sewer cost, based on usage - defined as all water that goes "down the drain."
 *
 * Summer is defined as May-Sep, winter is Oct-Apr.
 *
 * Usage is defined in whole gallons, but costs are calculated from CCF.
 *  1 CCF = 500 gal
 *  Costs are based on whole CCFs, rounded up - some examples:
 *   1500 gallons = 3 CCF
 *   1600 gallons = 4 CCF
 *   2400 gallons = 5 CCF
 *
 * Bills are calculated based on the following:
 *  Fixed cost is $35 per month, year-round.
 *
 *  Water cost:
 *   1 CCF costs $5.00 in summer and $3.00 in winter.
 *
 *  Sewer cost:
 *   1 CCF costs $4.00 year-round.
 *   In winter, every gallon of water consumed is considered "down the drain" (goes to sewer).
 *   In summer, only 75% of the water consumed is considered "down the drain."
 *    This is because some water is used for gardens, power washers, etc.
